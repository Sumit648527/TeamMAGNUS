# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Bol-Khata is a voice-first financial ledger system designed for 80 million+ semi-literate street vendors in India. The system enables vendors to record credit transactions (udhaar) and payments (jama) by speaking in their local dialect, eliminating the need for typing or literacy. The system uses government-aligned speech recognition technology (Bhashini/Sarvam AI) and provides audio evidence for each transaction.

## Key Features

### 1. Voice-First Transaction Recording
Record credit (udhaar) and payment (jama) transactions by simply speaking in your local dialect - no typing required.

**Visual Suggestion:** Illustration of a street vendor speaking into a mobile phone with speech waves, showing the transformation from voice to text to ledger entry.

### 2. Multi-Dialect Support
Supports Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali dialects, including code-mixed speech (Hinglish, Tanglish).

**Visual Suggestion:** Map of India highlighting the three supported language regions with language icons, or a diagram showing different speech bubbles in different scripts converging into one system.

### 3. Intelligent Customer Recognition
Automatically matches customer names using fuzzy matching, even when pronounced differently.

**Visual Suggestion:** Flowchart showing "Ramesh" → "Ramsh" → "Ramesh Kumar" with similarity scores, demonstrating the fuzzy matching algorithm.

### 4. Audio Evidence for Every Transaction
Every transaction is backed by the original audio recording for dispute resolution.

**Visual Suggestion:** Icon of a microphone with a lock/shield, or a timeline showing transaction → audio file → secure storage.

### 5. Instant Voice Confirmations
Hear transaction confirmations spoken back in your preferred language within 2 seconds.

**Visual Suggestion:** Circular flow diagram: Voice Input → Processing → Voice Confirmation, with a 2-second timer indicator.

### 6. Automatic WhatsApp Alerts
Customers receive instant WhatsApp notifications when payments are recorded, in their preferred language.

**Visual Suggestion:** Mobile phone mockup showing a WhatsApp message with transaction details in Hindi/Tamil/Bengali.

### 7. Real-Time Balance Tracking
Automatic balance calculations with every transaction - always know who owes what.

**Visual Suggestion:** Dashboard mockup showing customer list with color-coded balances (red for outstanding, green for paid).

### 8. Smart 3-Tier Language Processing
Uses regex patterns, keyword mapping, and AI fallback to understand natural speech accurately.

**Visual Suggestion:** Pyramid or layered diagram showing three tiers: Regex (fast) → Keywords (medium) → AI (flexible), with accuracy/speed indicators.

### 9. Government-Aligned Technology
Built on Bhashini and Sarvam AI - government-supported speech recognition platforms.

**Visual Suggestion:** Logo badges or certification icons for Bhashini and Sarvam AI with "Government Aligned" badge.

### 10. Secure & Private
Your customer data is completely private - other shopkeepers cannot access your information.

**Visual Suggestion:** Icon showing multiple user profiles with locks/barriers between them, emphasizing data isolation.

### 11. Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
Manages overpayments, ambiguous names, and low-confidence transcriptions with user verification.

**Visual Suggestion:** Decision tree or flowchart showing how the system handles edge cases with verification checkpoints.

### 12. Scalable Architecture
Microservices-based design can handle millions of concurrent users across India.

**Visual Suggestion:** Architecture diagram showing Voice Service + Banking Service with horizontal scaling arrows, or a map of India with distributed service nodes.

### 13. Offline-First Audio Storage
Audio files stored locally with cloud backup capability for reliability.

**Visual Suggestion:** Diagram showing local storage (phone icon) syncing to cloud storage with bidirectional arrows.

### 14. Fast Performance
2-second end-to-end processing from voice input to confirmation.

**Visual Suggestion:** Timeline graphic showing the journey from voice input to confirmation with time markers at each stage.

### 15. Resilient Error Handling
Continues operating even when external services fail - never lose a transaction.

**Visual Suggestion:** Network diagram showing primary and fallback paths (Sarvam AI → Bhashini fallback) with checkmarks and X marks.
